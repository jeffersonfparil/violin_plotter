## Version 1.0.1
This is an immediate patch to hide the functionality of the sub-functions:
  - mean_comparison_HSD.R
  - parse_formula.R
  - plot_regression_line.R
  - plot_violin_1x.R
This is to prevent the graphical parameter settings (par) set by the main function violinplotter.R to be messed up.

Additionally, I have removed the images in the README.md file for better documentation auto-rendering.
